Assignment 4: 
(1) C Program to compute sum of the array elements using 
pointers.

(2) C Program to find length of a given string using pointer.

(3)C Program to read 10 integers into an array from user 
and print them in reversing order using pointers. 

(4) C function to get the value of the smallest element in 
array using pointers.

(5) C function to copy all elements of an array into another 
array using pointers. The two arrays have the same length 
and types.

(6) C Program to print all the array elements and the 
maximum number in array using array of pointers.

(7) C function to swap two numbers using bitwise 
operation and call it using pointer to function.

(8) Write a C function to swap the contents of two arrays 
with the same length using pointers.

(9) Given a string, create a new string made up of its last 
two letters, reversed and separated by a space, the word
